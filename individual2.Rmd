##Question 1

1.The ratings are distributed in a 0-5 scale with 3- 3.5 points being the most common score in the data set.The mean of the histogram is 3.19101. In terms of outliers, it is definitely noicible that there are no ratings over 4 points and very few in the 0-1.5 range.

##Question 2

2. If we compare both histograms we see that the majority of percentege is around the middle as the rating of the cocoa. There is a correlation between the two. Although we do see that in the percentage graph, there are a few that are on the high end, 85% - 100%, but there are no ratings over the 4 point mark. Therefore, ratings do not necessarily depend on the percentage of the chocolate bar.
